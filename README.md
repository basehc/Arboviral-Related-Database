# Arthropod-borne Virus Database

The Arthropod-borne (Arboviruses) Virus Database is a comprehensive catalog of viruses carried by arthropods, developed as a significant part of our arthropod transcriptome virus identification program. Arboviruses are viruses that are transmitted by arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks, and can cause some of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the world, such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika. The importance of collecting annotated research on arboviruses is that it can help us better understand the diversity, characteristics, evolution and host interactions of arboviruses, and provide scientific basis and technical support for the prevention and control of these diseases. This database aims to give us a thorough understanding of virus variety, features, and virus-host interactions, which will aid in our understanding of the complexity of viruses carried by insects and other arthropods.

## Database Overview



The database encompasses detailed information on various viruses, including:

- **Name:** The name of the virus.
- **ICTV (MSL38.v1) Status:** Status based on table released by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
- **Order, Family:** Taxonomical classification of the virus.
- **Genome Type:** Describes the nature of the virus genome, e.g., RNA or DNA.
- **Data Source:** Origin of the recorded data.
- **TaxID:** Unique taxonomy identification number.
- **Rank Level:** Taxonomical rank level, e.g., species, genus.
- **Host:** Organism(s) the virus can infect.
- **Infect Vertebrate:** Whether the virus can infect vertebrates.
- **Infect Human:** Whether the virus can infect humans.
- **PMID:** PubMed identification number for related research.
- **Vector-borne Source:** The arthropod vector responsible for transmitting the virus.
